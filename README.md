# Barebones

Barebones is a customizable component library built for Vue and Nuxt. Barebones provides common components with local configuration files to customize props and styles. At present Barebones comes with one default theme built with Tailwind, however can be used with any CSS framework or custom CSS. In future we plan to add a number of starter themes.

The motivation for Barebones came from the desire to have a framework that provided all the functionality we rewrite over and over again but with the freedom to not be tied to themes or forced to overwrite styles. That may seem strange when you see that Barebones allows themes but this is totally optional, all the style configuration for these themes are configurable locally meaning no dirty overwrites.

## Add Barebones to a Vue 3 project

Add Barebones to your project with the by adding `@wearethreebears/barebones`, either via Yarn:

```
yarn add @wearethreebears/barebones
```
Or via NPM:
```
npm install @wearethreebears/barebones
```

Add the aliases to your paths in your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
    //
    "@barebones/*": [
        "node_modules/@wearethreebears/barebones/src/*"
    ],
    "@barebones-local/*": [
        "barebones/*"
    ],
    //
}
```

Add the aliases to your aliases in your `vite.config.js` file:

```ts
{
    //
    "@barebones": fileURLToPath(
        new URL(
        "./node_modules/@wearethreebears/barebones/src",
        import.meta.url
        )
    ),
    "@barebones-local": fileURLToPath(
        new URL("./barebones", import.meta.url)
    ),
    //
}
```

Next you will need to add the local configuration files using an NPX command. You can choose a blank canvas configuration, which will just contain the boilerplate for you to start adding your own props and classes or you can choose from one of the pre-made [theme](/guide/themes.html) configurations as a starting point.

To start with a blank canvas run:

```
npx @wearethreebears/barebones theme blank
```

To use a pre-made theme you can run a variation of the following command:

```
npx @wearethreebears/barebones theme <cssLibrary>/<themeName>
```

Where `<cssLibrary>` is the name of the library (e.g. Tailwind, Vanilla) and `<themeName>` is a theme within that library. [See all available themes here](/guide/themes.html).

You can then import components to Vue with the following pattern:
```ts
import Bones<ComponentName> from "@barebones/components/<ComponentName>/<ComponentName>.vue";
```

Where `<ComponentName>` is the name of the component you'd like to import.


## Add Barebones to a Nuxt 3 project

Add Barebones to your project with the by adding `@wearethreebears/barebones`, either via Yarn:

```
yarn add @wearethreebears/barebones
```
Or via NPM:
```
npm install @wearethreebears/barebones
```

Add the aliases to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
    //
    "compilerOptions": {
        "paths": {
        "@/*": [
            "./*"
        ],
        "@barebones/*": [
            "node_modules/@wearethreebears/barebones/src/*"
        ],
        "@barebones-local/*": [
            "barebones/*"
        ],
        }
    }
    //
}
```

Add the aliases to your `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```ts
import { resolve } from 'path'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
    {
        //
        alias: {
            "@": fileURLToPath(new URL("./src", import.meta.url)),
            "@barebones": fileURLToPath(new URL("./node_modules/@wearethreebears/barebones/src", import.meta.url)),
            "@barebones-local": fileURLToPath(new URL("./barebones", import.meta.url)),
        },
        //
    },
})
```

Auto import the components (By default this will prefix all Barebones components with `Bones`):

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    //
    buildModules: ['@wearethreebears/barebones/nuxt'],
    //
})
```

Next you will need to add the local configuration files using an NPX command. You can choose a blank canvas configuration, which will just contain the boilerplate for you to start adding your own props and classes or you can choose from one of the pre-made [theme](/guide/themes.html) configurations as a starting point.

To start with a blank canvas run:

```
npx @wearethreebears/barebones theme blank
```

To use a pre-made theme you can run a variation of the following command:

```
npx @wearethreebears/barebones theme <cssLibrary>/<themeName>
```

Where `<cssLibrary>` is the name of the library (e.g. Tailwind, Vanilla) and `<themeName>` is a theme within that library. [See all available themes here](https://barebones.wearethreebears.co.uk/guide/themes.html).

## Configuration

### Overview

Configuring Barebones components is simple. Each component will have 2 associated local files in your project, `.props.ts` and `.parts.ts`. These files will control the component props and component part styles respectively.

### .props.ts
`.props.ts` files determine the props you'd like to pass to you components, this allows you to shape the way you use component styles in a way that works for you. A simple example of what a components `.props.ts` could look like could be a `Column` component, a `Column` should `span` `x` amount of columns in a `Grid`, in the following example, whenever you used the `Column` component, you'd pass `x` to the prop `span`:

```ts
export const classProps: ClassProps = {
  span: {
    type: [String, Array] as PropType<string | string[]>,
    default: "default",
  },
};
```

In some cases, you or your team my prefer to change prop names, for example you may choose to change `span` in the above example to`cover`, in which case, you can change that in your local `Column` `.props.ts` file:

```ts
export const classProps: ClassProps = {
  cover: {
    type: [String, Array] as PropType<string | string[]>,
    default: "default",
  },
};
```

Now, instead of passing `x` to `span`, you can pass `x` to `cover`. `.props.ts files` don't stop at allowing you to change the names of existing props but also allow you to add your own. For example, you may want to add `starts` and `ends` props to `Column`, in which case you can simply add them here:

```ts
export const classProps: ClassProps = {
  cover: {
    type: [String, Array] as PropType<string | string[]>,
    default: "default",
  },
  starts: {
    type: [String, Array] as PropType<string | string[]>,
    default: "default",
  },
  starts: {
    type: [String, Array] as PropType<string | string[]>,
    default: "default",
  },
};
```

### .parts.ts

`.parts.ts` files are used to map props to CSS files. `Parts` refers to the elements that make up a component. Every component has a root element, with the part name `component`, each individual component then be made up of several other component parts, depending on the complexity. A simple example of what a `.parts.ts` file could look like could be a `Column` component `.parts.ts` file. A column has one component part, the root element, called `component`:

```ts 
// Base Classes

export default function ColumnLocal(): Column {
  const parts: Parts = {
    component: {
      span: {
        default: ["col-span-12"],
        '6': ["col-span-6"],
        '3': ["col-span-6"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

First level property keys in the `parts` object refer to the component parts in any given component, the second level refers to a prop key defined in the components `.props.ts` file. In the example above, the `Column` component has a prop called `span`. Third level properties are where the class mapping for each prop on each component part happens. In the above example, if you were to pass the value `"6"` to the `span` prop on the `Column` component, the element with the part name `component` would have the class `col-span-6` set. To see the component part names for each component, please see the individual component page. 

In some cases you may have a lot of repeated class names, in this case you can extract them to base classes above the `parts` object. Taking the `Column` component example above, let's say you'd like prop values `"3"` and `"6"` to be flexbox and have centered content you may do something like this:

```ts 
// Base Classes
const baseFlexClasses = 'flex items-center justify-center'

export default function ColumnLocal(): Column {
  const parts: Parts = {
    component: {
      span: {
        default: ["col-span-12"],
        '6': [baseFlexClasses, "col-span-6"],
        '3': [baseFlexClasses, "col-span-6"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

###Ã¥# DynamicParts

In some cases component `parts` may take advantage of `DynamicParts` type over `Parts` type - `DynamicParts` are used when specific package level props can make a significant difference in the way a component may be displayed, allowing for different default classes etc. `DynamicParts` still rely on locally defined class props but allows for different meanings across different types. An example of this is `FormInput` and `FormGroup`, each of these have a dynamic part controlled by the input `type prop`. `DynamicParts` should always have a `default` property which value is equal to a regular `Parts` type, this will cover all input type props unless a property key exists on `DynamicParts` matching an allowed `type prop`.

In the following example of how a `FormInputs` `DynamicParts` may be set up, all FormInputs will have a `border` class:

```ts
export default function FormInputLocal(): FormInput {
  const parts: DynamicParts = {
    default: {
      component: {
        style: {
          default: ["border"],
        },
      },
    },
  };

  return {
    parts,
  };
}
```

Sometimes though, we may want a different style for specific input types. In the following example, instead of a border, `file` type inputs would have a `bg-red` class, while every other type would continue to have a `border` class:

```ts
export default function FormInputLocal(): FormInput {
  const parts: DynamicParts = {
    file: {
      component: {
        style: {
          default: ["bg-red"],
        },
      },
    },
    default: {
      component: {
        style: {
          default: ["border"],
        },
      },
    },
  };

  return {
    parts,
  };
}
```

In most cases for `DynamicParts`, `default` is the only property key that needs to be set for each class prop key.
